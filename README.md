# DSA_WITH_JAVA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository is a collection of my self-study projects in DSA, where I explore and implement various algorithms and data structures independently. I am a BCA student pursuing this as a personal learning effort, beyond my college curriculum. Authored by Azharuddin Ali

# Day 1 Summary:
Completed 13 pattern printing programs in Java, including triangles, rectangles, pyramids, hollow shapes, and a butterfly pattern. These programs focused on nested loops, conditionals, and symmetry concepts. Added all files to the day1 folder in the Git repo with clear naming conventions for easy reference.

# Day 2 Summary:
 focused on strengthening problem-solving skills through array-based questions, patterns, and basic algorithm implementations. We started with pattern problems to enhance logical thinking using nested loops, followed by exploring functions with different parameter and return type combinations to understand their behavior in Java. Number system conversions (binary to decimal and vice versa) deepened our understanding of modular arithmetic. We also explored parameter passing in Java, differentiating between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference using array modifications. Searching algorithms like linear and binary search introduced the basics of element lookup. Array manipulation tasks included reversing arrays (both normally and memory-efficiently), finding the largest and smallest elements, generating pairs, and working with subarrays. Optimization problems like maximum subarray sum and trapping rainwater introduced performance considerations and auxiliary data structures. We concluded with a dummy stock trading problem, calculating maximum profit by identifying optimal buy and sell days. The day provided a comprehensive foundation in arrays and problem-solving logic, preparing us for more advanced challenges.
