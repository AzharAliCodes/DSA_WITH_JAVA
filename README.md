# JAVA_DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository is a collection of my self-study projects in DSA, where I explore and implement various algorithms and data structures independently. I am a BCA student pursuing this as a personal learning effort, beyond my college curriculum. Authored by Azharuddin Ali
