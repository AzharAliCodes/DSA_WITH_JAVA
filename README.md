# DSA_WITH_JAVA
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repository is a collection of my self-study projects in DSA, where I explore and implement various algorithms and data structures independently. I am a BCA student pursuing this as a personal learning effort, beyond my college curriculum. Authored by Azharuddin Ali

# Day 1 Summary:
Completed 13 pattern printing programs in Java, including triangles, rectangles, pyramids, hollow shapes, and a butterfly pattern. These programs focused on nested loops, conditionals, and symmetry concepts. Added all files to the day1 folder in the Git repo with clear naming conventions for easy reference.

# Day 2 Summary:
 focused on strengthening problem-solving skills through array-based questions, patterns, and basic algorithm implementations. We started with pattern problems to enhance logical thinking using nested loops, followed by exploring functions with different parameter and return type combinations to understand their behavior in Java. Number system conversions (binary to decimal and vice versa) deepened our understanding of modular arithmetic. We also explored parameter passing in Java, differentiating between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference using array modifications. Searching algorithms like linear and binary search introduced the basics of element lookup. Array manipulation tasks included reversing arrays (both normally and memory-efficiently), finding the largest and smallest elements, generating pairs, and working with subarrays. Optimization problems like maximum subarray sum and trapping rainwater introduced performance considerations and auxiliary data structures. We concluded with a dummy stock trading problem, calculating maximum profit by identifying optimal buy and sell days. The day provided a comprehensive foundation in arrays and problem-solving logic, preparing us for more advanced challenges.

 # DAY 3 Summary:
 Today, I worked on a series of 13 Java programs, covering various essential concepts like user-defined packages, method overloading, constructor overloading, applets, and virtual environments. I started by creating a user-defined package to better organize classes, followed by setting up a virtual environment to run applets, ensuring the programs run smoothly without interfering with the system configuration. I explored method overloading, where I created multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to handle various input types. I also worked on constructor overloading by defining multiple constructors in a class to initialize objects in different ways. I implemented multithreading with three threads (A, B, and C) running concurrently to perform different tasks. Additionally, I practiced exception handling, managing errors such as array index out-of-bounds, and demonstrated method overriding and inheritance by creating subclasses that provide specific implementations of methods from the parent class. I also worked on single-level inheritance, where one class extended another to inherit its properties and methods. I manipulated strings using various methods like `indexOf`, `substring`, `toLowerCase`, and `replace`, and sorted an array using the bubble sort algorithm. I wrote programs to calculate the factorial of numbers and check if they are prime, using command-line arguments for input. 

For my environment setup, I used a virtual workspace to ensure a clean and isolated environment for running applets and other Java programs. The workspace is configured with all necessary Java tools and libraries, and I created a dedicated folder structure for organizing my projects. I used an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write, compile, and test my code efficiently. By leveraging version control with Git and uploading my work to GitHub, I ensured my code was properly tracked and easily accessible for review and collaboration. This setup allowed me to work with different Java features and ensured that the applet and virtual environment ran seamlessly, keeping everything organized and functional.
